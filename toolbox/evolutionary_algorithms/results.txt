Decreasing the probablility of crossover made the program find longer strings more easily because it became more likely that a new letter would be added.  However, increasing the probability of mutation, which would also increase the probablility of adding a new letter, just decreased the stability of the results.  With a higher probability of mutation, the distance would increase much more frequently.  Significantly increasing the probability of crossover also made the program find the solution more quickly.
